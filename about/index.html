          <p> <b>Randy Lower</b>
            <br>Senior developer</p>
          <p class="my-4 text-left">Randy Lower has over 30 years experience in the field of real estate, working in many and various facets, and I can tell you that I enjoy what I’m doing with CV Real Estate Solutions the most.</p>
          <p class="my-4 text-left">Randy is able to maximize what a seller can receive for their home if they can be a little flexible on when they cash out. If they are willing to taking payments for a short period I can typically bring them a full price offer.</p>
          <p class="my-4 text-left">The buyers Randy works with can afford a mortgage payment and have a sizable down payment, but for one reason or another cannot qualify for traditional financing immediately. Most believe this prevents them from obtaining what they want the
            most – the home of their dreams where they can raise their family! CV Real Estate Solutions can help them!</p>

          <p><b>Vincent Bui</b>
            <br>UI designer</p>
          <p class="my-4 text-left">Vincent Bui has always seen himself as an opportunist. His willingness to try new things and helping others has made him who he is today. Vincent enjoys being creative and creating processes to enhance himself and those around him. He has ventured
            into numerous industries, including networking, financials, real estate, taxes and construction management. Vincent considers himself a people person and always extends a helping hand. As a loving husband and father, Vincent enjoys spending
            time with his family.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="my-4 text-left">Vincent has always loved construction and has an eye for detail and creativity, making him an effective builder. His love for construction has helped extend his business strategy to real estate investing.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="my-4 text-left">Working and networking with people have always been Vincent’s strong traits. This is evident, especially working in the financial industry, when helping many people with residential mortgages for over 15yrs and acting as a conduit for commercial
            financing. Helping others has always been Vincent’s motto.</p>
